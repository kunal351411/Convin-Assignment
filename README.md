## Problem Statement

Make a React application</br>
• On loading, of the page, make an API request to fetch all users. ( LIST USERS API
Endpoint)( https://reqres.in/)</br>
• Store all the data in the redux store</br>
• get the total number of users from the response and make those many buttons on the
web page ( do not hard code the number, it has to come from the API)</br>
• for example: [ 1 ] , [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ].... [ n ]</br>
• on clicking the button retrieve that users data only using [ SINGLE USER API Endpoint ) (
do not use data from the previous API call )( https://reqres.in/)</br>
• do not add event listeners to each button</br>
• after retrieving show the response, create a card and fill info on the page, only one user
card will be shown at a time.</br>
